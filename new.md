## Markdown file

- I learned about using github, different styles used in markdown file and little bit about virtual studio
### example
 1. Some basic Git commands 

 * git status
 * git add
 * git commit

 2. some markdown styles

 * for links ()
  * (https://docs.github.com/)
 * for quotes ``` ```
  * ``` github ```
